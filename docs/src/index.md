# Bessels.jl

## Introduction

Bessels is a collection of mathematical algorithms to compute special functions written entirely in the Julia programming language. It is focused on providing high quality implementations of mathematical functions that are accurate and highly perfomant. Since it contains only Julia code and has no external dependencies, it provides a lightweight dependency for any high performance software while taking advantages of the dynamism of the Julia language.

Bessels contains numerous definitions of special functions important in many fields of mathematical physics. Available functions include Bessel, Modified Bessel, Spherical Bessel, Airy, Hankel, and Gamma functions. A full list of availabe functions can be found in the API section of this documentation. Initial development has focused on providing implementations for real arguments, however, some functions (e.g., Airy) also accept complex numbers as input.
